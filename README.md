# Female inactivity rate in EU, Aged 25-54, in years 2019, 2020 and 2021
Statistical analysis of the EU data in R Female Inactivity Rate aged 25-54 Dataset LFST_R_LFP2ACTRTN (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/lfst_r_lfp2actrtn/default/table?lang=en)

Inactivity Rate: is the percentage of inactive persons in relation to the comparable total population .Inactive persons meaning persons part of the Labour force but are not employed/working.

Inactivity Rate = 100 - Activity Rate
(Activity rate is the percentage of active persons in relation to the comparable total population.)

Economic Importance: In an economy or in the EU, we can know in each age group who are economically active/inactive. It will help for planning.

## Conclusion of Analysis

The educational levels edu-high, edu-medium and edu-low all independently affect the inactivity rate (do not have the
same distributions).
The years/periods observed: 2019, 2020 and 2021 almost all have the same distribution on the activity rate (there is no
significant difference in their effects on EU Female Activity Rate).
The more educated an EU female in the age range 25 â€“ 54, the lower their inactivity rate.
MICE PMM algorithm is an effective tool for generating missing values in a dataset, and was employed here.
It is seen that the highest inactivity rates come from ITF 3, ITF 4 and RO12. The inactivity rate in Italy is supported by this
